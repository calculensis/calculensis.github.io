<p>Like writing? Like learning foreign languages? Like role playing games? Here is a to-do list game I made up that has all three:</p>
<p>(a) Pick a word from the target language. It can be one that you’d like to learn, or a random one from the dictionary, or just a word that you like. </p>
<p>(b) The letters in the word determine certain features of your surroundings (I based the following identifications off letter frequencies in Latin; feel free to change them for your target language):</p>
<p>“a”: there is a door (or some open path) toward the east from your current position</p>
<p>“s”: door to the north</p>
<p>“t”: door to the west</p>
<p>“u”: door to the south</p>
<p>If any of these letters shows up more than once in the word, then the door is locked (or the pathway blocked). To go in a currently inaccessible direction, you will need the word to have the letter... </p>
<p>“c”: there is a key somewhere near you (or some means of unblocking an inaccessible direction)</p>
<p><img src="images/key.jpg" width="200"/></p>
<p>Each key can be used exactly once, after which it disappears!</p>
<p>(c) Okay, so now you have your word, and through it know some basic facts about your surroundings. The next step is to write a sentence in the target language describing what’s happening; that sentence has to contain the word you chose.</p>
<p>(d) Now do a real-world task with whatever degree of chunkiness you deem appropriate, after this task is completed...</p>
<p>(e) ...you can choose to stay in your current area or not. Either way, choose a new word and write another sentence for your story using that word.</p>
<p>If you chose to stay where you are, the letters of the word will have no effect on your surroundings, but if you chose to go through a door then the word’s letters will determine the basic characteristics of your new surroundings.</p>
<p>(f) Do a task after each new sentence. As you progress through the story, keep a little drawing showing where you’ve been as well as locked and unlocked paths, as shown below: You may need to revisit places to move your story forward!</p>
<p>And that’s it – happy adventuring :)</p>
