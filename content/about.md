Hello, I'm Kayla Lewis, a professor in the New York City area who loves using and thinking about decision intelligence, that is, those parts of data science, the behavioral sciences, and managerial science that are most relevant to decision making.

Herein I write especially about how we can use simple math models, systems thinking, and machine learning to improve the quality of our decisions.
