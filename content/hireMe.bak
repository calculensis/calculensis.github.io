As your personal consulting data scientist, I can:

- apply machine learning (ML) to your data (examples [here](https://www.thedecisionblog.com/category/machine-learning.html))
- help solve problems where collecting and analyzing data is relevant
- help you select and apply the best systems thinking framework to situations involving people complexity or lots of moving parts (examples [here](https://www.thedecisionblog.com/category/systems-thinking.html))
- show you structured modeling approaches to support your decision making (examples [here](https://www.thedecisionblog.com/category/simple-tools.html))
- listen without judgment and give compassionate, honest feedback

---
<em>I use time-tested methodologies - from applied rationality, systems thinking, and ML - to enable your decision making, particularly to provide structure in situations with a lot of uncertainty. Most importantly, I am someone you or others involved can be at ease talking to.</em>

For more about me, see the [about](about) page; here is what you can expect when working with me:

- During an initial phone or video consultation (with no fee), I will listen carefully and ask a series of questions to get a clear picture of your situation as well as what you'd like to accomplish.

- If there's a good fit between your needs and my skill set, we will schedule to meet afterward as appropriate; my rate is $150 per hour.[^1]

[^1]: Fees are sliding scale, i.e., based partly on ability to pay and on international currency exchange rates.
