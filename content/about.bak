Hello! My name is Kayla Lewis, and this blog explores my passion for combining applied rationality, systems thinking, and machine learning to solve problems in business and in life. For those who are curious, here is a little about how I came to be involved in these areas:

I have always been driven by a deep passion for improving decision-making and harnessing the power of computation in this pursuit. My journey began during my physics major at Georgia Tech, where I discovered the potential of applying principles from physics to solve practical problems beyond the confines of the discipline. As I delved into increasingly complex physical systems, I embraced systems thinking as an invaluable tool for managing complexity.

Motivated by my fascination with dynamic systems, I pursued a PhD in computational physics, using principles of physics to study underwater volcanic systems. This interdisciplinary research challenged conventional disciplinary boundaries and fueled my interest in holistic approaches to problem-solving. During this time, I entered a teaching collaboration with a biologist at the University of Chicago, expanding my understanding of decision theory through the integration of evolutionary biology, behavioral economics, and philosophy of science.

To further refine my computational skills, I embarked on a postdoctoral assignment at Los Alamos National Lab, working alongside renowned expert George Zyvoloski. Here, I immersed myself in simulation, optimization, statistical analysis, and machine learning, gaining valuable expertise in these areas. Additionally, I recognized the critical importance of interpersonal dynamics in effective team management, which led me to embrace soft systems thinking.

As a tenured faculty member at Monmouth University, I impart my knowledge of multi-model and systems thinking in physics, while also teaching a dedicated course on effective decision -making. In my research endeavors, I continue to leverage computational and systems approaches to drive innovation.

The culmination of my journey lies at the intersection of decision making, systems thinking, statistics, and machine learning, where data science becomes a powerful tool to inform and drive strategic decision-making.

"*It has been my pleasure to know Dr. Lewis as a colleague in the Department of Chemistry and Physics at Monmouth University since she joined the department in 2013 and as Department Chair through most of that time.  Prior to my time at Monmouth University, I was the Director of Chemical Synthesis Research and Vice President (R&D) at International Flavors and Fragrances, and during that time period I also served as Committeeman and Mayor of Jackson Township, NJ.*

*With my various forms of managerial experience, I quickly came to appreciate the very thoughtful and rational approach Dr. Lewis takes to her professional work and to her life in general.  I have seen how successful it has been in advancing her career and could readily appreciate the value her approach to rational decision making could bring in a wide variety of professional and managerial activities.  I would have eagerly availed myself of the service she is offering had it been available.*"
