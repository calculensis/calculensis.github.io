<p>Hello everyone, welcome to my first blog entry!</p>
<p>This blog will be about all things related to effective decision making. </p>
<p>I'm going to start with simpler approaches or models that don't take very much time and build up to the more sophisticated ones.</p>
<p>A common theme will be that looking at a decision through as many lenses as possible, given our time constraints, is extremely useful; in this first post I want to explain why that is.</p>
<p>Making decisions is a kind of thinking, and one of my favorite models describing how thinking works is the search-inference framework. As applied to decision making, it says that thinking has three stages:</p>
<p>(1) We generate a space of possible actions or vantage points</p>
<p>(2) By using the evidence currently available to us, and in light of our goals, we evaluate the strength of each possibility</p>
<p>(3) We choose, or infer, the strongest possibility</p>
<p>The most common mistakes in thinking can be traced to failing at step (1) or (2). For step (1), the common failure is not generating a rich enough space of possibilities; for step (2), it's not weighing the evidence for each possibility fairly. I'll talk about this second way of failing in later posts.</p>
<p>Viewing a decision through multiple lenses or models is a way of lowering the probability that we fail at step (1): Each model gives us a different way of viewing the decision we want to make.</p>
<p>Very often, different models will tell us to take different courses of action. It might seem like this is a problem, but in reality it's a strength. Instead of hoping that all models will give the same answer, what we'll do is try to understand <strong><em>why</em></strong> the different approaches give the answers that they do; in so doing, it will usually become clearer which choice we ultimately want to make.</p>
<p>You can think of asking models what they "think" just as you would ask your friends what they think. Your friends might give conflicting answers, and that's a good thing! You are definitely expanding the space of possibilities to consider when that happens.</p>
