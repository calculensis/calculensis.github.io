<p>Hello! My name is Kayla Lewis, and this blog explores my passion for combining applied rationality, systems thinking, and machine learning to solve problems in business and in life. For those who are curious, here is a little about how I came to be involved in these areas:</p>
<p>I got my PhD from Georgia Tech back in 2007, in geophysics, which drew me to it because of its multidisciplinary and systemic nature. The topic of my thesis - underwater volcanic systems - was the very embodiment of these concepts. I completed almost all of the work remotely, living on campus at The University of Chicago.</p>
<p>At that time, I started collaborating with a biologist there to teach courses on judgment and decision theory through a combination of evolutionary biology, behavioral economics, epistemology, Bayesian probability, and philosophy of science. The collection of mental models and habits of thought at the intersection of these areas later came to be known as "applied rationality."</p>
<p>After Chicago, I completed a three year postdoctoral assignment at Los Alamos National Lab in New Mexico, because I wanted to hone my computational skills be working with George Zyvoloksi, a world-class leader in the field: It was here that I started to become better acquainted with simulation, optimization, statistical analysis, and machine learning. It was also here that started to become aware of the importance of interpersonal dynamics between teams and team managers, which would later lead me to soft systems thinking to compliment the traditional hard systems methodologies I had been using.</p>
<p>After New Mexico, I was hired and eventually became tenured faculty at Monmouth University in New Jersey. Here Iâ€™ve been teaching about multi-model, systems thinking, and applied rationality, while continuing to apply computational and systems approaches to my research.</p>
<p>When you combine applied rationality, systems thinking, statistics, and machine learning, you arrive at the subjects I write about here as well as the tools I use in decision advising.</p>
