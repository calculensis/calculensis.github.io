<p>Following the <a href="https://www.thedecisionblog.com/seven%20paradigms%20of%20systems%20thinking.html">organismal perspective</a>, think for a moment about what kinds of modules you would need, from a neurological perspective, in order to create a living, purposeful, organism that could survive in a turbulent environment<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>(1) There would need to be a set of interfaces through which the organism could sense and interact with its environment on a basic level.</p>
<p>(2) These interfaces would need to be coordinated with one another.</p>
<p>(3) The organism would need some way of sensing (not necessarily consciously) whether those interfaces were working properly and making the necessary changes if not.</p>
<p>(4) There would need to be a way for the organism to learn what's going on in its environment and consider more global changes it might make to its behavior in order to perform better, a kind of R&amp;D center.</p>
<p>(5) For the organisms to be purposeful, it would need a kind of executive control center that factors in what's going on in the other systems to some extent and gives meaning to the organism's experience.</p>
<p>If we continued this way and thought very hard about how modules 1-5 above would need to be wired to each other, we very well might end up with Stafford Beer's Viable System Model.</p>
<p>The amazing thing about that model is that it provides a blueprint for how any system might best be designed to be able to thrive in a changing and largely unpredictable environment.</p>
<p>"System" here can be taken very broadly, for example: "the system of a corporation" (an example of which is shown below, with all the appropriate "wiring"); "the system of me, my social media accounts, and my blog"; "a non-profit organization", etc.</p>
<p><img src="images/viableSystem.png" width="300"/></p>
<p>By looking at systems as if they were organisms and asking how modules 1-5 are instantiated in each particular instance, whether they are present in the real-world system, and whether they are wired together correctly, we can very often find ways of increasing their viability.</p>

<p>A jellyfish doesn't seem purposeful in the full sense intended here (e.g., it doesn't attach meaning to its experience), but it embodies the other ideas well and it's pretty :)&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
