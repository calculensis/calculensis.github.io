&lt;p&gt;Let's say that you have a bunch of interrelated decisions to make and that, after consideration, you're able to narrow down the choices you need to make into three areas (these areas are pretty me-centric, but the numbers/interrelationships are going to be mostly made up just as an example): whether to work remotely or in-person, whether to move to Europe or stay in the US, and whether to obtain a position as a decision scientist, a more generic data scientist, or as an AI alignment researcher. We can write some graphviz code to picture the situation as shown below, where a line connecting two choices will mean that those choices are incompatible for whatever reason (for example, suppose you're only willing to work in-person if it's in Europe):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;graph G {
  rankdir = &amp;quot;LR&amp;quot;
  node [ style = filled, fillcolor = coral, shape = record, margin = 0, penwidth = 2, fontsize=50 ]

  a [label=&amp;quot;area 1 | &amp;lt;a1&amp;gt; remote | &amp;lt;a2&amp;gt; in-person&amp;quot;, fillcolor=cadetblue1 ]
  b [label=&amp;quot;area 2 | &amp;lt;b1&amp;gt; decision sci | &amp;lt;b2&amp;gt; data sci | &amp;lt;b3&amp;gt; alignment&amp;quot;, fillcolor=darkorange2 ]
  c [label=&amp;quot;area 3 | &amp;lt;c1&amp;gt; europe | &amp;lt;c2&amp;gt; usa&amp;quot;, fillcolor= limegreen ]

  edge [ penwidth = 5, color = black ]
  a:&amp;lt;a1&amp;gt; -- b:&amp;lt;b3&amp;gt;
  edge [ color = crimson ]
  a:&amp;lt;a1&amp;gt; -- b:&amp;lt;b1&amp;gt;
  edge [ color = blue  ]
  a:&amp;lt;a2&amp;gt; -- c:&amp;lt;c2&amp;gt;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Tpng&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;decisionAreas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;decisionAreas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;png&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;matplotlib.pyplot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;matplotlib.image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;mpimg&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;matplotlib&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;inline&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mpimg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;imread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;decisionAreas.png&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;axis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;off&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;imshow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="png" src="./images/decision_areas.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After storing these decision areas and incompatibilities in a few data files, we can use python to construct a table showing all possible decision paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;numpy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;itertools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;area1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read_csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;area1.csv&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;area2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read_csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;area2.csv&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;area3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read_csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;area3.csv&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;block&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read_csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;block.csv&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;combos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;area1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;area 1&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;area2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;area 2&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; \
                      &lt;span class="n"&gt;area3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;area 3&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;combos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DataFrame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;combos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;area 1&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; \

&lt;p&gt;We would like to evaluate each of these paths so that we can choose the best one, but which path turns out to be best also depends on an uncertain aspect of the future, say, whether you would be able to make any significant difference in the field of AI alignment. Let's say you put that probability at 0.10 or 10%. Then we end up with a table like the one above but where the value of each decision path (say on a scale from 0 to 10) has to be determined for two different futures, f1 (where you do make a big difference in the field) and f2 (where you don't):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above table encapsulates a &lt;a href="https://www.thedecisionblog.com/decision%20trees.html"&gt;decision tree&lt;/a&gt; where, because of the values entered for f1 and f2 (which you get by going through the possibilities, having a conversation with your gut, and rating them), the top choice ends up being an in-person decision science position in Europe (value 9.0), but only by a small margin over a remote data science position in Europe (value 8.8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, if the model gives numbers that don't seem quite right, that's an opportunity to better understand why as well as to more fully reveal your preferences. Also as usual, it's a good idea to explore more than just one model!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a systems approach called SAST (Strategic Assumption Surfacing and Testing), in which you would typically do the following with a collection of people after separating them into groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each group defends a position on whatever the issue of relevance happens to be, such that the groups cover a good range of perspectives; for each group, if possible, there's another group defending an opposing view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then each group is asked what assumptions they are making about various stakeholders in order for their position to be correct. These assumptions are then rated on certainty and importance: It's the assumptions of high uncertainty and high importance that are crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After each group has presented and has its position criticized by the other groups, a synthesis is attempted that factors in the strong points of each group's original position; if a synthesis cannot be reached, at least the key uncertainties have been identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the above is typically done with groups of people, I've found it useful to role play these groups' positions with clients and lead them through the process described above for issues of importance to them, i.e., to simulate a SAST workshop. I add my thoughts to theirs and record the results of each step digitally using words and graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach works well because it leads us to consider unusual ideas more seriously than we otherwise would have and hence to learn from those perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have an idea of what the &lt;a href="https://www.thedecisionblog.com/the%20viable%20system%20model.html"&gt;viable system model&lt;/a&gt; (VSM) is all about, let's look at a specific example: tweeting as a viable system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our example, suppose I've decided to hire six people to manage my English and Latin tweets (they're all just me of course wearing different hats). Then each of these employees would inhabit a different subsystem of the VSM, as shown in the diagram below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="images/twitterVSM.png" width="300"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this setup, we can illustrate several important features of the VSM:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the bottom subsystems forms a viable system in its own right: Each is an account with a person running it; each could have its own whole VSM diagram. In this way, the VSM structure is said to be &lt;em&gt;recursive&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these two subsystems are to be part of a coherent whole, they need to be orchestrated in some way; that's the job of the person in the triangular subsystem labeled 'coord.' For example, the two accounts might at times strategically reference each other's tweets; the coordinator would inform the two account operators when such is the case and about other relevant details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manager in tweet quality control (who I sometimes consider firing) supports the tweeters by offering ways to increase engagement, which she periodically monitors. She also gives guidance on aligning tweets with the overall brand and identity of the enterprise. It's equally important what she doesn't do: She doesn't go down into the individual subsystems and look over the tweeters' shoulders while they're trying to do their jobs; she doesn't micromanage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last point is worth emphasizing. The tweeters need to  be able to creatively make tweets and address problems as they come up, which they can't do if they are constantly worried about upsetting management. Also, if the manager is always looking over their shoulders, she is not thinking as much about other things that need her attention. The environment offers a &lt;em&gt;variety&lt;/em&gt; of issues to address, and those closest to those issues are usually in the best position to deal with them. They can act effectively only if they are given the autonomy to express their own &lt;em&gt;requisite variety&lt;/em&gt; in response to the environment. Only a variety of internal responses can handle the variety offered up by an unruly reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we have the trend monitor, who looks at the rest of the twittersphere and keeps up with important happenings. Should we consider making video content? That seems to be getting more and more popular. Is Elon Musk going to own Twitter? What changes can we expect? And so on. This job is hugely important lest the whole enterprise become irrelevant in a fast-changing environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we have an upper management person in brand/identity. It's tempting to see the VSM as hierarchical, with this top system exerting control down the line and running things. But that would be a mistake! Information travels both upward and downward, and the identity of the whole should be able to change as the organism evolves within its environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upper manager needs to factor in the information from trend monitoring as well as tweet quality control and decide what direction would represent all stakeholders the best, giving the enterprise the best chances of continuing to flourish. Who are we? Why are we tweeting? What are we trying to do? These questions are continually revisited and their answers revised in upper management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the &lt;a href="https://www.thedecisionblog.com/seven%20paradigms%20of%20systems%20thinking.html"&gt;organismal perspective&lt;/a&gt;, think for a moment about what kinds of modules you would need, from a neurological perspective, in order to create a living, purposeful, organism that could survive in a turbulent environment&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) There would need to be a set of interfaces through which the organism could sense and interact with its environment on a basic level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) These interfaces would need to be coordinated with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) The organism would need some way of sensing (not necessarily consciously) whether those interfaces were working properly and making the necessary changes if not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) There would need to be a way for the organism to learn what's going on in its environment and consider more global changes it might make to its behavior in order to perform better, a kind of R&amp;amp;D center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(5) For the organisms to be purposeful, it would need a kind of executive control center that factors in what's going on in the other systems to some extent and gives meaning to the organism's experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we continued this way and thought very hard about how modules 1-5 above would need to be wired to each other, we very well might end up with Stafford Beer's Viable System Model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amazing thing about that model is that it provides a blueprint for how any system might best be designed to be able to thrive in a changing and largely unpredictable environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"System" here can be taken very broadly, for example: "the system of a corporation" (an example of which is shown below, with all the appropriate "wiring"); "the system of me, my social media accounts, and my blog"; "a non-profit organization", etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="images/viableSystem.png" width="300"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By looking at systems as if they were organisms and asking how modules 1-5 are instantiated in each particular instance, whether they are present in the real-world system, and whether they are wired together correctly, we can very often find ways of increasing their viability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Estimatrix/status/1555693184977600512?s=20&amp;amp;t=YFPoxpEQ2Qp14U4FliD7fA"&gt;Discuss on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A jellyfish doesn't seem purposeful in the full sense intended here (e.g., it doesn't attach meaning to its experience), but it embodies the other ideas well and it's pretty :)&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose there's a sense of unease at an organization you work for or in your personal life. There's definitely a problem, but even formulating what that problem is seems difficult. For concreteness, we'll stick with the example of an organization, though it's important to remember that systems thinking ideas are also relevant to improving our decision making as individuals in our personal lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then, perhaps the organization's management is widely perceived as being ineffective or not as effective as it could be. Perhaps different parts of the organization don't seem to be learning from one other enough or at all. The environment in which the organization finds itself has become turbulent and no one knows what to do about it. Maybe there's a mess that combines all these things and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of scenario is what the different schools of systems thinking were created to address; in future posts, I'll be describing each of these approaches in turn, the situations each is ideally suited for, and how to combine the different approaches with one another for maximum effect. Most of what I will be writing in this area follows M.C. Jackson's book on critical systems thinking&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before delving into the specific systems thinking frameworks, it's vital to discuss the major paradigms or ways of viewing the world that underlie them. To get the most benefit out of systems thinking, we'll need to become adept at inhabiting each of the paradigms, switching between them, and criticizing each from the perspectives of the others. It's important to mention that each paradigm has deep roots in philosophy and the social sciences, and that ideally we would want to immerse ourselves in that material as well. I plan to write about these roots later, after we have an overall map of the territory and an idea of how things work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first paradigm to discuss is that of the machine: We view the organization under consideration as an assemblage of moving parts that takes certain inputs and produces certain outputs. To be functioning correctly, the parts of the machine need to be coordinated to produce the desired outputs and produce them efficiently. This kind of thinking can be very powerful; at the same time, it's important to know that many people naturally fall into this approach automatically when engaging in systems thinking, and that doing so can be harmful. For example, treating people as if they were machine components can lead to disastrous consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second and very powerful paradigm is that of the organism: We view the system in question as an organism that needs to adapt to a complex, changing environment in order to survive and thrive in the world. For a living creature to be healthy, its parts need to individually be healthy and functioning in harmony with one another. The organism has to be able to sense (at least to some extent) if there's a problem internally and track changes that are occurring around it. Living things also modify their immediate environments, in a sense creating their own micro-climates, to make it easier for their needs to be met. This paradigm emphasizes the functions that the parts perform for the sake of the whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, there is the cultural paradigm: We view the organization as a collection of individuals who give meaning to the situations in which they find themselves; this meaning-creation gives rise to habitual ways of thinking and acting, social structures that in turn can influence individuals and their perceptions, in a kind of feedback loop. For an organization to succeed as a cultural entity, there need to be ways of ensuring that the people in it have enough of a shared vision of the organization's purpose that it doesn't fall into chaos; there need to be ways of fostering helpful modes of collective behavior and attenuating unhelpful ones. Also, there is a crucial balance to be sought between maintaining order on the one hand and encouraging originality and creativity on the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth paradigm is political, and invites us to view the organization as a collection of factions that have different worldviews and whose purposes will sometimes be at odds with one another. The organization will require effective means to resolve disputes fairly and find enough common ground between the different coalitions so that progress can still be made. This paradigm pays attention to how power is obtained, how it's used, and who has how much of which kind. Power is often distributed in hierarchies, both intentionally and not; being unaware of such dynamics is to be controlled by it, and usually to maintain a status quo that favors those holding the most power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pondering unequal distribution of power leads us to our fifth systems view, called the coercive paradigm: Some groups within the organization are not given a seat at the decision making table or, if they are, their views are nevertheless not taken seriously. Sometimes people who are excluded may not even be aware that they are being treated unfairly. Under this paradigm, those who are oppressed need to, if necessary, be made aware of it and be given tools to aid in making their voices be heard. An intervention is successful to the extent that it succeeds in emancipating the oppressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to the organismal view and focusing on the effects that an organism has on its surroundings leads to the sixth, environmental, paradigm: Organizations exist in environments that contain other organizations, forming an ecosystem; neglecting consideration of the environment, or of the goals of other organizations, or of whether the organization under consideration's goals are aligned with those of society at large, would be a big mistake: If an organism poisons its own environment then it can't survive; if it works against the interests of the ecosystem as a whole then other entities will likely align themselves against it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seventh paradigm is that of interconnectedness: All of the above paradigms are interconnected with one another. Power structures can determine culture, both can determine whether the parts of an organization are functioning in harmony together; these things in turn can affect how well an organization acts as a steward of its environment, etc. We are successful under this paradigm to the extent that we are able to see the entire system as a whole. This last ideal is just that: An ideal. It's impossible to have a god's-eye-view and see everything that could possibly be relevant together with all interactions. However, in doing our best to approach this ideal, we do much better than if we did not try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other paradigms that are important to know: Postermodernist and feminist come immediately to mind. But we will leave our description of paradigms for now, because the ones at our disposal are adequate to describe where each of the systems approaches that we will be discussing is coming from. Again, in using each of these approaches it will be important to mentally inhabit that approach's associated paradigm as fully as possible. Otherwise, the most likely outcome is that we subconsciously slip into acting in the service of only one paradigm, which in turn will render our systems interventions sub-optimal.&lt;/p&gt;
