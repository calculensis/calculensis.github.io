<p>It seems like there are two extreme intuitions that are commonly held about how best to go about decision making: The first is to say "The hell with models - I can do just fine by myself!" and the second is "Sure I can use some help, and the more sophisticated the better! And by sophisticated, I mean AI." </p>
<p>Both of these ideas reject using simple pencil-and-paper models, to their detriment! I'll explain why for each in turn.</p>
<p>Regarding the first idea - that we do just fine by ourselves - there are many factors mitigating against this notion, but in the interest of space I'll focus on just one: the recency effect. This effect is our tendency to give whatever we were thinking about most recently a greater weight than other factors that we want to influence our decision. So, for example, to decide where we want to go for vacation, suppose we care about affordability and location. If the last thing we were considering is location, then affordability likely won't get as much weight as it deserves when we are making our final decision. </p>
<p>Again, if we are taking a multi-lens approach - that is, looking at the decision from many different perspectives - then we run the risk of giving the last lens we looked through more power than it deserves. </p>
<p>We can overcome these problems by using simple pencil-and-paper math models, which will maintain the proper weights because those weights will be contained in the relevant equations for each model we consider.</p>
<p>Another important consideration is that decisions often seem to involve a lot of variables, and to get anywhere it helps to try and boil these dimensions down to just a few things that matter the most; making a model forces us to go through that process. It's true that AI can also help us simplify things this way...</p>
<p>...which brings us to the second of the extreme intuitions: That the only thing that will do better than we do is something computationally sophisticated like machine learning (a type of AI). For many decisions we don't have time to collect months worth of data (or spend time trying to find and clean data that may already be out there somewhere) and run analytics on it. In fact, for many decisions we don't even start out knowing what data would be relevant or what questions we would want to ask of that data!</p>
<p>A middle approach is to do something that improves on our native mental abilities but that doesn't involve computation - in other words, pencil-and-paper modeling.</p>
<p>In the next few posts I'll share some of these models with you!</p>
